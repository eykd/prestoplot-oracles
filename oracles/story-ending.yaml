    {StoryEndTypeOpposites[key] if StoryEndType[key] == 'opposites' else StoryEndTypeDramaticIrony[key]}


StoryEndTypeOpposites:
  - |
    The Opposites Ending: move the reader sharply from one emotional state to its opposite.

    Study your complications and your Obvious ending, and create the exact opposite of the Obvious Ending.

StoryEndTypeDramaticIrony:
  - |
    The Dramatic Irony Ending: occurs when a serious divergence between what your character believes to be true and what your reader knows to be true, results in something happening to the character that is, to the character, totally unexpected... but that the reader understands perfectly.

    Tell the story in first person, presenting the character receiving the dramatic irony through the eyes of the character who delivers the irony, or witnesses its delivery.

    For the first complication, second complication, and ending, write out what the character thinks is true, and how that is different from what the reader knows is true.


StoryEndKey:
  - |
    Hide the key to the ending in plain sight in the first complication.

    **Keep your key subtle.** It has to be where the reader can find it, can see it, can even see it work, but then you downplay its importance.
