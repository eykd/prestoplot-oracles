Hook:
  - "Solicitation: The simplest of plot hooks—an NPC (unknown to the characters) comes to the characters and asks for their help."
  - "Dead Body: The characters encounter a corpse, which has some clue on it regarding the Fiendish Plot."
  - "Disaster: A horrible disaster occurs, somehow related to the Fiendish Plot, and draws the characterʼs attention."
  - "Attack: An attack occurs (on someone other than the characters), somehow related to the Fiendish Plot."
  - "Bizarre Occurrance: A strange, inexplicable event happens, somehow related to the Fiendish Plot. In the tradition of the pulps, the more outlandish and bizarre, the better."
  - "News: The characters read a story in the paper, or hear a story on the radio, that is related to the Fiendish Plot."
  - "Friend in Need: Similar to the Solicitation hook, except that the NPC is a friend of the characters. The NPC comes to the characters for help."
  - "Up to Our Necks: The characters are involved in the plot from the starting gun. They are attacked, or implicated in a crime, or the victim of a theft, or somehow made to suffer in a manner that is directly related to the Fiendish Plot."
